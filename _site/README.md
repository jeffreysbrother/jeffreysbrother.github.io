#My Portfolio Site, created with Jekyll#

This is my first attempt at creating a website using [Jekyll](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-blog-with-jekyll-and-github-pages)---a Ruby-powered system that generates a static site from HTML, CSS, markdown, Liquid (a templating language), and YAML Front Matter.

The original motivation behind using Jekyll came after I found [this course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-blog-with-jekyll-and-github-pages) on Treehouse. I have since customized the site quite a bit; I've added some original content (blog posts and photography), modified the default layout, and implemented a third-party contact form (Formspree) and commenting system (Disqus).
