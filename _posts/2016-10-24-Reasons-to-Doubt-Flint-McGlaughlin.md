title: "Reasons to Doubt Flint McGlaughlin"
---

Flint McGlaughlin is the founder and director of MECLABS. He has a [website](http://www.flintmcglaughlin.com/) that makes use of media queries, but no viewport meta tag. He also studies *offer response* and *value proposition* optimization, and considers himself a philosopher.

Last week, I was coerced into watching a series of "training videos" created by Flint and his twink assistant Brad or Denny or whatever. In what follows, I will attempt to articulate the reasons for doubting the results of his research, his methodology, and his oversized blazer.

Here is an abbreviated list of some of the hilarious features of said video:

1. He spends an inordinate amount of time micro-engineering the sales funnel analogy.
2. He invents superfluous concepts such as (Ma)YES, presumably in order to give truisms the appearance of theory.
3. He references a 201% increase in leads (*i.e.* captured emails), but fails to mention the sample size.
4. He unveils the heuristic *Rc[Vf - Cf] = Nf*, which might be the most excellent example of a truism imaginable.

Why are these things so entertaining? Perhaps it's not clear why. Here's a nice, little aphorism:

> False things are boring. Unjustified things are funny. Sophistical things are motherfucking hilarious.

The best thing about Flint is his consistency; virtually every claim is unjustified. If a claim *is* justified, it's likely a truism. If not a truism, it's probably a silly attempt to redesign the immaterial features of some worn-out analogy. "The funnel is actually, like, covered in a smooth membrane that prevents the micro-yesses from ... and there's a valve at the end of the funnel that is actuated by the cumulative thoughts of mankind ..."

Just in case my attitude on this matter is unclear, let's apply Flint's heuristic mentioned above. The cost (**Cf**) of consuming this nonsense drastically outweighs the value (**Vf**) of my doing so. Why do I think this? Because no attempt is made to substantiate *any* of it.
