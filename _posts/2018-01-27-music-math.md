It recently came to my attention that some people believe that music is math (or, perhaps stated more conservatively, that music is mathematical in nature). This assertion is a mistake. Unlike other mistakes, this one is relatively inoccuous but I'm going to talk about it because I've been drinking wine.

Below you'll see a section of [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjKaOfpJkWY) that I've been teaching myself for the last couple weeks. Ask yourself this: what would cause a person to think that such a thing is mathematical (either a performance, the notation, or perhaps the cultural phenomenon of music in general)? I believe that people arrive at this erroneous conclusion by pursuing two different lines of bad reasoning.

Before we get into the bulk of this nonsense, I'd like to eliminate one potential refutation from the vat of horrible refutations that I'm anticipating. I am *not* suggesting that music cannot be mathematical because such a conception would drain all life from the music in question. My opinion has NOTHING to do with the opinion that "precision" lends itself to sterility and all "emotion" lends itself to authenticity.

So anyway, here's the damn thesis: music might be classified as mathematical due to aesthetic (and superficlal reasons), or for mechanical reasons. Both lines of reasoning are the result of mistakes.

**The Aesthetic, superficial argument**: [Just look at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF8GhC-T_Mo). Sheet music has symbols. Mathematicians use symbols. Also, both of these things are difficult to comprehend! Music and mathematics share these qualities, so they must share essential underlying properties! Oh, and perhaps we might add that both musical notation and mathematical notation are instructions for computation which may or may not result in a desired outcome (higher/lower test scores or predictability, more/less mechanical failure, greater/lesser pleasure at Ruth's piano recital).

All of that is wrong. Musical notation *is* instructional in a similar way that a first-order proof allows us to grasp the validity of some intended line of reasonsing or that a well-formed integral equation allows us to comprehend the details of a calculation pertaining to the area marked off by some arbitrary boundary. However, many things are instructional: the drunk driving school guy, the embarrassingly idiotic sex-ed course you were forced to take in middle school, the arrogant and unjustified relationship advice given by a 21-year-old to a 19-year-old. Instruction, symbol, and difficulty occurr everywhere in life so we shouldn't pretend that these elements capture the unique nature of mathematics.

**The Mechanical argument**: Just look at how many intricate subdivisions of duration, magnitude, and frequency are required for any musical production. This must imply that music, at its base, is mathematical!

No.

The E string of a classical guitar resonates at some semi-determinate frequency (based on material, structrual integrity, altitude, etc.)... a combustion motor has resonant properties based on many factors including RPM, stroke length, bore size, combustion ratio, fuel used ... the height of a person depends on the length limbs, all of which can be analyzed into smaller components and measured.

This is not math. Surely, mathematics is our best tool for measurement in certain domains, but it is completely silly to believe that a subject matter's *potential measurability* ought to be the determining factor that settles the question of whether that subject matter *is* itself mathematical.

Does the subject matter of music pertain to the formalized calculation and permutation (multiplication, equality, etc.) of generalized value (magnitude: length, quantity, duration, weight, number)? In musical notation, the only true values are the ones imprecisely specified, there are no operations performed on these values, and there is no prediction that might result of from these non-existent operations.

So if music is not math, what is it? Just music?
