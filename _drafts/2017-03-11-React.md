React is a declarative, component-based JavaScript framework for building user interfaces (usually in the context of single-page applications). The purpose of this short post is to provide a high-level introduction to some of React's most salient features.

The most obvious benefits of using React are: reusability, modularity, and its ability to keep the data model and the DOM in sync, efficiently. In React, we define a virtual DOM using JavaScript rather than normal HTML elements. When the state of our application changes, React is able to compare the new state to the previous state in order to determine the minimum changes necessary to update the *real* DOM tree (rather than simply re-drawing the entire UI to reflect changes in data).

- getting set up: npm, babel, webpack, axios for HTTP requests
- npm init
- touch .gitignore (add node_modules)
- npm install --save react react-dom
- npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react
- file structure?
  app/index.html
  app/index.js
  webpack.config.js
  package.json
  .gitignore
  .babelrc

1. create a stateless component
2. create a component with state
3. props
4. nested components
5. routing
6. JSX ... passing data via props, className attribute

typical features of a React application:::
react-core
react-dom
react-router
JSX
ES6
ES2015
babel
webpack
npm for dependency management
