title: "Logic"

The difference between logic and mathematics appears to be a difference between objects of abstraction. Logic abstracts from particular sentential units (assertions, claims, arguments, words), while mathematics abstracts from units of a much more narrow category: only those units that somehow relate to quantity or magnitude. So, on the one hand, we have valid permutations of assertions in natural language, while on the other we have valid permutations of assertions of quantity (natural or otherwise).
