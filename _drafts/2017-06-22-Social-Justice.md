title: "Social Justice: Part 1"
---

For many, a critique of "social justice" seems absurd and morally questionable. What clear-headed, sympathetic individual would be opposed to justice in society? Only a bigot would hold the belief that one social group ought to have more privileges than another or that one group ought to have the legal right to oppress another. A similar line of thought often motivates contemporary Progressivism; isn't *progress* a good thing?

Obviously, grasping the name of a movement is not enough to determine the tenets, quality, or legitimacy of that movement. Like many restaurants (imagine one such as "Jose's World Famous Sushi" or "Clancy's Best Ethiopian Fare"), Social Justice and contemporary Progressivism are deceptive labels for despicable and embarrassing political trends.

My intention is draw attention to these absurd, irrational, and hateful ideas and then attempt to point out, tentatively, potential sources of that sickness. Postmodernism is most definitely upstream. Black Lives Matter, feminism, and modern Leftism have all been influenced by these ideas, without a doubt. The university system, too, in the U.S. and elsewhere is filled with professors who propagate these unsupported ideas and politicized "studies" as if they were scientific fact.

A truly disappointing feature of this degenerate, pseudo political-philosophical is the tendency of its adherents to circumvent fruitful discussion. If a Social Justice Warrior is questioned, doubted, or offered an alternative, she will---almost always---respond as if she were being attacked. For her, disagreement amounts to hatred, bigotry, and oppression. If an appeal to reason or evidence is made by her opponent, she will insist that logic and science are oppressive tools of the patriarchy. She will launch into a lecture; the individual with an alternative outlook will, in her mind, become transformed into a bigot even when there is no reason to make such a claim. The SJW, therefore, insists upon creating an insulated space (a "safe" one) where her sub-par ideas can flourish not by way of merit, but because all alternatives are either silenced or completely unknown to the adherents.

Having the "correct" beliefs is primary (interestingly, this is very much like conservative evangelicals). The ideal situation for the SJW is not investigation, contemplation, and dialectic ... but merely to have the correct beliefs.

The favoring of lived experience over logic is a genuine mistake in thinking. It's a false dichotomy that arose probably from some lazy academician. There is no question that indifference has the effect of improving the reliability of investigations of a certain kind (for example, scientific questions, ones pertaining to human reasoning, or mathematical ones). But the person who appreciates logic or scientific endeavors in general is not a person who completely disregards lived experience. In actuality, the outlook is that lived experience has no relevance when trying to determine the answer to certain questions: whether plant matter is made of cells has no bearing on black culture or the experience of individuals living in high income areas of New York or a blind autistic girl's experience of rape trauma.

A similar misunderstanding has convinced a lot of people that individualism, a tenet of Liberalism, is flawed. (more stuff here)

Misunderstanding of Liberalism (of individualism)

Emotional issues. Inability to discuss points of disagreement.

Tendency to lecture entire groups of people: Dear White People.

Prohibitions and requirements! Tendency to have feelings enforced and turned into policy. (like evangelicals...sin)

Fictions: gender

Ad hominem.

Dogma (also like evangelicals)

reiteration of slogans and buzzwords (like evangelicals). Maybe this is because that's all they can do. Can't engage in conversation so they merely ridicule or resort to pre-made sentences from books they never read that were written by people who can't tell the difference between shit and shinola.

Racist. Against the West, tall rich white able-bodied straight cis males, republicans, libertarians, classical liberals of all colors, christians, educated people. A division between privileged people and everyone else. Brown versus black. Asians as fake minorities.

Culture mongering.

guilt and privilege mongering. diversity is advocated for questionable reasons (either for its own sake, or because they believe that white and asian people are oppressing all other varieties of people)

Bad arguments against gun control. This points out another feature: contradiction. If the SJW is opposed to logic and if she thinks that all ideas are on equal footing, why would she insist on deploying arguments against a perspective or policy she feels to be inferior. Also they think all cultures should be valued but hate "white" culture (probably without considering the massive differences that exist between Spanish, Irish, German, Russians, Jews...)

We shouldn't pretend that this group of people is completely uniform. In fact, they're a fairly diverse bunch: some believe in the extraordinary power of crystals, some support a superficial, sensationalistic, and politicized variety of pseudo-scientific inquiry, some

There's a positive side to this madness, however. The astonishingly low-quality attitude and all-around shittiness of the radical anti-Liberal Left  has created a situation where I can have a much better conversations now with Conservatives and religious people. It's true that a great connection can occur between people with very different beliefs. Of course, this is a lived experience that SJWs deny out of hand.
