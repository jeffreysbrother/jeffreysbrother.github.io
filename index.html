    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>James Cool</strong> and I'm a web developer. I'm interested in task runners, scaffolding tools, responsive design, and templating languages. I like JavaScript. I'm also interested in formal logic. In my spare time, I write music in order to keep myself away from philosophy.</p>
