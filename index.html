    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>James Cool</strong> and I'm a web developer. I'm currently interested in automation tools and static site generators. I like JavaScript. In my spare time, I write music in order to keep myself away from philosophy.</p>

    <p>To see some of my current projects, experiments, and miscellaneous exercises, please visit me on <a href="https://github.com/jeffreysbrother">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~jeffreysbrother">npm</a>. If you're interested in seeing other things I've done, visit <a href="http://jeffreysbrother.com/">jeffreysbrother.com</a>. You can also find me on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jamescool">Treehouse</a>.</p>

    <p>
      if you have any questions or if you suspect that I might be able to assist you in some way, feel free to email me at
        <strong>
          <script language="JavaScript">
            var username = "jeffreysbrother";
            var hostname = "gmail.com";
            var full = username + "@" + hostname;
            document.write(full);</script></strong>. This is the best way to contact me if your inquiry pertains to programming or technology. While I tend to be busy, I'm interested in collaborating on open source projects.
    </p>

    <p>A current version of my r&eacute;sum&eacute; is available <a href="http://jeffreysbrother.github.io/other/2016-resume-update-noA.pdf">here</a>.</p>
