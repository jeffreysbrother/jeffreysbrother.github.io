    After studying philosophy at UC Berkeley, and after *almost* learning (on separate occasions) Python, Visual Basic, and Ruby, I eventually started teaching myself web development. Right now I am spending most of my time with JavaScript and PHP.</p> -->

    Hi, I'm James Cool and I'm a web developer. I'm interested in task runners, scaffolding tools, responsive design, and templating languages. I like JavaScript. I'm also interested in formal logic. In my spare time, I write music in order to keep myself away from philosophy.</p>
