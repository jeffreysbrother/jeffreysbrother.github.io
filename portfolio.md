This site was originally built using just Bootstrap, PHP, Sass, and Grunt. However, I've since converted the original design into a WordPress theme in order to add a blog (at the time I was interested in getting some experience with WordPress and wasn't yet aware of Jekyll or other static generators).

Yes, *this* very site. The one you're looking at now. This was my first attempt at using a static site generator (Jekyll, in this case). Static site generators allow us to implement blogging functionality and dynamically-styled navigation *without* using a server-side language (in the traditional sense) or a database. I was also able to successfully include a contact form (by Formspree) and a commenting system (by Disqus). The moral of the story is that the bits of functionality typically handled by a database or a server-side language are handled either by a third-party service or by a templating language (Liquid, in the case of Jekyll).

A friend of mine already had a simple website. I wanted to get some practice building out a pre-existing design, and so offered to make some improvements. Now the site is fully responsive and has a contact form with validation (which I built and extended). I also replaced the links to SoundCloud with HTML5 audio elements and used jQuery to improve user experience (by ensuring that only one audio element can be playing at any given time).
