<!-- [jeffreysbrother.com &#10147;](http://jeffreysbrother.com/)
This site was originally built using just Bootstrap, PHP, Sass, and Grunt. However, I've since converted the original design into a WordPress theme in order to add a blog (at the time I was interested in getting some experience with WordPress and wasn't yet aware of Jekyll or other static generators). View the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreysbrother/WordPress-integration).
*NOTE: This site is currently undergoing renovation.* -->


[This portfolio site &#10147;](https://github.com/jeffreysbrother/jeffreysbrother.github.io)
This was my first attempt at using a static site generator (Jekyll, in this case). Static site generators allow us to implement blogging functionality *without* using a server-side language or a database. I was also able to successfully include a contact form (by Formspree) and a commenting system (by Disqus). The moral of the story is that the bits of functionality typically handled by a database or a server-side language are handled either by a third-party service or by a templating language (Liquid, in the case of Jekyll).

[SpacesJS &#10147;](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spacesjs)
This is a small Node module used to rename local files. Running it will replace all instances of any contiguous collection of hyphens and spaces with a *single* hyphen, and then convert all uppercase characters to lowercase ones. This is particularly useful if your design team can't remember to name image assets in a reasonable manner.
