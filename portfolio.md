<!-- Below is a list of completed web projects currently live on production servers. These sites were built using a variety of technologies, but they all exemplify responsive, mobile-first design principles.

[jeffreysbrother.com &#10147;](http://jeffreysbrother.com/)
This site was originally built using just Bootstrap, PHP, Sass, and Grunt. However, I've since converted the original design into a WordPress theme in order to add a blog (at the time I was interested in getting some experience with WordPress and wasn't yet aware of Jekyll or other static generators). View the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreysbrother/WordPress-integration).

A friend of mine already had a simple website. I wanted to get some practice building out a pre-existing design, and so offered to make some improvements. Now the site is fully responsive and has a contact form with validation (which I built and extended). I also replaced the links to SoundCloud with HTML5 audio elements and used jQuery to improve user experience (by ensuring that only one audio element can be playing at any given time).
