Hi, I'm James Cool. After studying philosophy at UC Berkeley, and after *almost* learning (on separate occasions) Python, Visual Basic, and Ruby, I eventually started teaching myself web development. Right now I am spending most of my time with JavaScript and PHP.

I'm interested in automation tools and responsive design. I'm also a proponent of self-guided education. In my spare time
