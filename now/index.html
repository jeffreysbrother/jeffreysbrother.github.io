<p>Following the trend outlined <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">here</a>, I've decided to throw together a "now page". The goal is to explain what I'm doing at this point in my life, in a big-picture-updating-an-old-friend sort of way:</p>

<ul class="now-list">
  <li>Living in San Diego, California</li>
  <li>Studying JavaScript and trying to become more familiar with Linux</li>
  <li>Fiddling around with <a href="https://donejs.com/">DoneJS</a> (an open source MVVM framework that supports server side rendering, progressive loading, testing, documentation, ES6 modules, modlets, custom HTML elements, hot module swapping, generators, and iOS/Android/desktop builds)</li>
  <li>Conducting research for a book idea related to logic and contemporary Liberalism (so-called). This will probably never happen, but what the hell.</li>
  <li>Considering whether a new <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeffreysbrother/tracks">music</a> project would be a good idea</li>
  <li>Reading Plato's <em>Gorgias</em> and Hegel's <em>Logic</em></li>
</ul>
