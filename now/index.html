title: What I'm doing now

<p>Following the trend outlined <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">here</a>, I've decided to throw together a "now page". The goal is to explain what I'm doing at this point in my life, in a big-picture-updating-an-old-friend sort of way:</p>

<ul class="now-list">
  <li>Living in San Diego, California</li>
  <li>Conducting research for a book idea related to logic and contemporary Liberalism (so-called). This will probably never happen, but what the hell.</li>
  <li>Considering whether a new <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeffreysbrother/tracks">music</a> project would be a good idea</li>
  <li>Attempting to learn plain JavaScript more better</li>
  <li>Reading Plato's <em>Gorgias</em></li>
  <li>Fiddling around with my knife and going to the shooting range, LOL</li>
  <li>Watching horror movies virtually every night</li>
  <li>Putting up with a fairly pernicious skin condition</li>
  <li>Trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to do with my life...</li>
</ul>
